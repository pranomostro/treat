.TH TREAT 1
.SH NAME
treat \- run different fields of the input through different filters

.SH SYNOPSIS
program [-i INSEP] [-o OUTSEP] [FILTERS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
treat runs different input fields through different text filters specified by the user.
The nth field is run through the nth filter specified. If no filter is specified for a
field, the field is run through cat(1). The resulting fields are pasted together and
printed. The input is separated by tabs or spaces, the output is separated
by tabs by default, with the options -i and -o one can specify the input- and
output separator, respectively.
Without any arguments, treat behaves like cat.

.SH EXAMPLE
.TP
.B treat

Uses the human(1) utility by z3bra.
.TP
.B df | sed '1d' | tr -s '\t ' ' ' | treat cat human human human | column -t
do the same thing as df -h, but by combining programs.

.SH STATUS
0 on success and 1 when it prints the help message.

.SH BUGS
At the moment, it is not possible to change the input/output separators
without diving into the code.
