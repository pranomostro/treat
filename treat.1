.TH TREAT 1
.SH NAME
treat \- run different fields of the input through different filters

.SH SYNOPSIS
program [-i INSEP] [-o OUTSEP] [FILTERS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
treat runs different input fields through different text filters
specified by the user.  The nth field is run through the nth filter
specified. If no filter is specified for a field, the field is run through
cat(1). The resulting fields are pasted together and printed. The input
is separated by spaces/tabs, the output is separated by tabs by default,
with the options -i and -o one can specify the input separator (a lua
regular expression) and the output separator (argument for paste -d),
respectively.  Without any arguments, treat behaves like cat.
